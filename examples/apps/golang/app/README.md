# Golang basic Rest API

## About Repository:

This repository is a simple project I initiated to explore the process of building a REST API server using Golang. Its purpose is to delve into setting up routers, controllers, and experimenting with various aspects such as HTTP methods, requests, response objects, and parameters.

## Software(s) required:

* [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)

## Project Set-up:

* #### Step 1: 

Navigate to the root directory of the project and execute:

```
go run .
```

This will initialize the REST API server.
